# Zawadi Human Capital Partners

Zawadi is a global healthcare employee recruiting application featuring p2p and client-admin messaging, application storage and editing. Prospective employees are able to contact admin with a preliminary application which can be accepted or denied within the admin portal. Once preliminary acceptance is given, a username and temporary password is mailed to the applicant along with a link to sign in to the employee portal. This is where application documents are submitted along with messaging functionality which can be used peer to peer or to administration.
